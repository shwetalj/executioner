- **Virtual Rendering**: For workflows with 100+ nodes
- **Debouncing**: Throttle expensive operations
- **Web Workers**: Offload layout calculations
- **Canvas vs SVG**: Evaluate best rendering approach

### State Management
```javascript
// Enhanced state structure
canvasState: {
  nodes: [],
  connections: [],
  selectedNodes: [],
  selectedConnections: [],
  zoom: 1.0,
  panX: 0,
  panY: 0,
  gridEnabled: false,
  snapToGrid: false
}
```

### Event Handling
- Unified event system for canvas interactions
- Proper event delegation for performance
- Touch support for tablets

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation between nodes
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode
- Focus indicators

## Success Metrics
- **Selection Speed**: < 100ms response time
- **Large Workflows**: Support 500+ nodes smoothly
- **Undo/Redo**: Instant with full state restoration
- **Learning Curve**: New users productive in < 5 minutes
