Code and Functionality Duplication Findings
=========================================

1. Duplicate Implementations: validate_env_vars
------------------------------------------------
- jobs/env_manager.py and jobs/env_utils.py both define a function called validate_env_vars.
  - In env_manager.py, it is a placeholder and simply returns True.
  - In env_utils.py, it is also a placeholder and returns True.
  - env_manager.py imports validate_env_vars from env_utils.py, but then redefines it, which is redundant and can cause confusion or bugs if the two implementations diverge.
- Recommendation: Remove the duplicate in env_manager.py and use only the one in env_utils.py.

2. Duplicate Implementations: get_previous_run_status and JobHistoryManager
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- db/history.py and jobs/job_history_manager.py both define a class called JobHistoryManager with a method get_previous_run_status.
  - In db/history.py, the class and method are stubs/placeholders.
  - In jobs/job_history_manager.py, the class is fully implemented and used in the main codebase.
- jobs/executioner.py also has a method _get_previous_run_status that duplicates the logic of get_previous_run_status in JobHistoryManager.
- Recommendation:
  - Remove or refactor the stub in db/history.py if it is not used.
  - Refactor jobs/executioner.py to use the JobHistoryManager.get_previous_run_status method directly, rather than duplicating the logic.

3. Job Execution Logic: run Methods
------------------------------------
- jobs/job_runner.py and jobs/executioner.py both have a run method that handles job execution, retries, and logging.
  - Both methods implement similar retry logic, timeout handling, and job status updates.
  - There is a risk of these implementations diverging, leading to inconsistent behavior.
- Recommendation: Consider consolidating job execution logic into a single class or utility, or ensure that one is a thin wrapper around the other to avoid code drift.

4. General Observations
------------------------
- There are several utility functions (e.g., for environment variable handling, job status, and database access) that are defined in multiple places or imported and then redefined.
- There are placeholder or stub files/classes (e.g., in db/history.py) that may be legacy or unused.
