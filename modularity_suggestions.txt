Modularity Suggestions for Job Execution Engine
=============================================

Below are opportunities for further modularization in your current architecture:

1. Environment Variable Management
   - Current: Environment variable merging and validation is handled inline in job execution.
   - Modular Option: Extract an EnvManager or utility function for this purpose.

2. Notification System
   - Current: Email notification logic is in JobExecutioner.
   - Modular Option: Move all notification logic to a NotificationManager class.

3. Command Validation & Security
   - Current: Command validation logic is in JobExecutioner._validate_command.
   - Modular Option: Move to a CommandValidator class or module.

4. Job Queue & Scheduling
   - Current: Job queueing and scheduling logic is in JobExecutioner.
   - Modular Option: Extract a JobScheduler class.

5. Configuration Loading & Validation
   - Current: Some config loading/validation is in JobExecutioner, some in config/loader.py and config/validator.py.
   - Modular Option: Centralize all config logic in a ConfigManager class.

6. Job Execution Logic
    - Current: JobRunner is already a good abstraction, but could be further split (command execution, retry logic, output streaming, timeout handling).

7. Output Formatting
    - Current: Color and summary formatting is handled inline.
    - Modular Option: Move to a Formatter or SummaryPrinter class.

8. Testing Utilities
    - Current: Test scripts are in the repo, but test harness logic could be modularized for automated testing.

Summary Table
-------------

| Concern                | Current Location         | Modular Option                |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Env Vars               | Inline                  | EnvManager                    |
| Notification           | JobExecutioner          | NotificationManager           |
| Command Validation     | JobExecutioner          | CommandValidator              |
| Job Queue/Scheduling   | JobExecutioner          | JobScheduler                  |
| Config                 | JobExecutioner/loader   | ConfigManager                 |
| Job Execution          | JobRunner               | Further split (see above)     |
| Output Formatting      | Inline                  | Formatter/SummaryPrinter      |
| Testing Utilities      | Scripts                 | TestHarness                   |

How to Proceed
--------------
- Pick one area (e.g., environment variable management, etc.) to modularize next.
- Design and implement the new module/class, and refactor the code accordingly.
