DRY Opportunities in the Executioner Codebase
============================================

2. Environment Variable Handling
-------------------------------
Multiple places parse, merge, validate, and substitute environment variables (executioner.py, jobs/env_manager.py, jobs/executioner.py, etc.).
* DRY Solution: Consolidate all environment variable logic (parsing, merging, substitution, validation) into a single utility module (e.g., env_utils.py). Ensure all code uses these shared functions.

3. Database Connection and Query Patterns
----------------------------------------
Direct use of sqlite3.connect and similar database access patterns are present in several files.
* DRY Solution: Create a database helper or context manager to handle connection setup, teardown, and error handling. This reduces boilerplate and risk of connection leaks.

4. Job/Run Status and Retry Logic
---------------------------------
Repeated logic for updating job status, retry history, and handling job execution results in job_history_manager.py, job_runner.py, and related files.
* DRY Solution: Abstract common job status and retry logic into shared methods or a mixin/base class.

5. Time Period and Date Handling
-------------------------------
In timeperiod.py, functions for handling years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds share similar logic for range checking, normalization, and error handling.
* DRY Solution: Refactor repeated range-splitting, normalization, and validation logic into shared helper functions. Consider using decorators or higher-order functions for repeated validation patterns.

6. Error and Exception Handling
------------------------------
Many modules repeat similar try/except blocks for error handling, especially for database and config validation.
* DRY Solution: Use decorators or context managers for common error handling patterns, especially for database and config operations.

7. JSON Serialization
---------------------
Repeated uses of json.dumps and json.dump for serializing retry history and other data.
* DRY Solution: If you have custom serialization logic, centralize it in a utility function or class.

8. Config Validation
--------------------
Validation of job and config fields (e.g., checking for required keys, types) is repeated in several places.
* DRY Solution: Use a schema validation library (like pydantic or cerberus) or create a shared validation utility.

9. Magic Values and Constants
----------------------------
Constants like database file names, color codes, and status strings are scattered.
* DRY Solution: Centralize all constants in a single module (e.g., constants.py) and import where needed.

10. Class Initialization Patterns
--------------------------------
Many classes take similar arguments (e.g., logger, config, job_id, etc.) and set them as attributes.
* DRY Solution: Use a base class or a mixin for shared initialization logic.
