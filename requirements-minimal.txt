# Minimal Requirements for Executioner Modernization
# Based on constraints: No ORM, Oracle instead of PostgreSQL, limited package approval

# Current requirement
pytest>=6.0.0

# Python 3.6 compatibility (small, essential)
dataclasses>=0.6; python_version < '3.7'
typing_extensions>=3.7.4  # Just extends stdlib typing

# Oracle Database Support (instead of PostgreSQL)
cx_Oracle>=7.3.0  # Oracle database driver (supports Python 3.6+)
# Note: Requires Oracle Instant Client to be installed separately
# Download from: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html

# That's it for absolutely essential packages!
