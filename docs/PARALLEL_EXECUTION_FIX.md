# Parallel Execution Bug Fix

## Problem Description
Parallel execution was completely broken - no jobs were being executed at all. The application would start, wait for about 1 second, then exit claiming all jobs were "skipped" with unmet dependencies (even for jobs with no dependencies).

## Root Cause
The bug was introduced by our earlier race condition fix. We added a "double-check" to prevent duplicate job submissions:

```python
# Line 773: Job marked as active
self.active_jobs.add(job_id)

# ... later ...

# Line 790: Check if job is active (always true!)
if job_id in self.active_jobs:
    continue  # Skip submission
```

This created a logic error where:
1. A job would be pulled from the queue
2. The job would be marked as "active" 
3. When trying to submit, we'd check if it was active
4. Since we just marked it active, the check would always be true
5. The job would never be submitted
6. Eventually all jobs would be pulled from queue but none submitted
7. The main loop would exit with empty queue and no pending futures

## Solution
Removed the redundant double-check since:
1. The job submission already happens inside a lock
2. The entire check-and-submit operation is atomic
3. The job state is properly tracked through the `active_jobs` set

## Fixed Code
```python
if should_submit:
    with self.lock:
        # Submit the job (removed redundant check)
        future = self.executor.submit(self._execute_job, job_id)
        pending_futures.add(future)
        self.future_to_job_id[future] = job_id
        self.logger.debug(f"Submitted job {job_id}")
        jobs_queued += 1
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Simple parallel test (2 independent jobs) - SUCCESS
- ✅ Complex parallel test (5 jobs with dependencies) - SUCCESS
- ✅ All jobs execute in parallel as expected
- ✅ Dependencies are properly respected
- ✅ No duplicate job submissions observed

## Lessons Learned
1. Be careful when adding defensive checks - they can introduce new bugs
2. Always test after making concurrency-related changes
3. The original code was thread-safe due to the lock; the extra check was unnecessary
